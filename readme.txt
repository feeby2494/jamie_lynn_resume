My lastest final CV and remume are in pdf and odt format. docx files may be out of date.

My CV is more about my detailed love of building things, learning things, and understanding things and how all this fits into my passion for python web developemnt.

I figured that since I had trouble finding the positives about myself that I should objectly look at my past to see a deeper connection to my current development activies and learning. I didn't talk about technical unserstanding in great detail and certainly did not mention my defeicenies. 

I'm not one of those who believes they understand everything and the more I learn the more I realize how much I don't understand. This feeling of inadacity and the rejections of my many applications have taken a toll on my mental health and on my self image. I could write the longest paper detailing all the things I don't understand, but it will certainly make me sad and anyone who reads it sad. This negativity has plagued my resumes, CV letters, interviews, meeting with other people, and my own device reapair site. 

I've come to regognize my unobjective persecptive of myself and my anti-marketing campaing agaisnt myeslf. I had to dig into my past to put this negativty in it's place. I'm ready to start marketing myself in a positive light, but I also know that I will continue to struggle with personal depression, ADHD tendencies, and many things that other defeated, unemployeed people face.  

With this stated, please enjoy what I have in my resume and CV letter. Look at my github and other projects.
